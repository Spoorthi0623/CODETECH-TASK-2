### Overview of the task

### Task 2: STUDENT GRADE TRACKER

### Objective: 
The goal is to develop a Python program to efficiently track and manage student grades. The program should allow users to input grades for various subjects or assignments, compute the average grade, and provide a comprehensive summary, including letter grades or GPA.

### Key Activities:
Input Handling: Prompt the user to enter grades for subjects or assignments.
                Allow flexibility in the number of subjects or assignments.
Data Storage: Store grades in an appropriate data structure (e.g., list or dictionary) for efficient processing.
Grade Calculation: Calculate the average grade.
                   Determine the corresponding letter grade or GPA based on predefined thresholds.
Output Display: Display a summary including-Grades entered for each subject/assignment,Average grade and Letter grade or GPA.
Error Handling: Handle invalid input.

### Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python-Ideal for rapid development and readability.
Data Structures: Lists or dictionaries to store grades.
Built-in Functions: input(), print().
Control Structures: if-elif-else for grade categorization.

### Key Insights:
Flexibility in Data Input: The program should allow users to enter varying numbers of grades, adapting to real-world scenarios like incomplete data.
Clear Grade Classification: Use standardized grading systems for consistency.
User Experience: A well-designed interface that simplifies grade entry and interpretation will enhance usability.
Scalability: The framework can be extended to include advanced features, such as:
             Weighted grades for assignments.
             Visual representation of performance trends.
             Exporting data to a file for reporting.
Practical Application: This project showcases real-world problem-solving using Python and reinforces concepts like data handling, validation, and basic algorithms.
